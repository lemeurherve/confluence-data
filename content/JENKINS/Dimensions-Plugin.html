</p><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-Pre-requisites">Pre-requisites</h1><p>New releases of the plugin are tested with the most recent major version of Dimensions CM, version 14.x at the time of writing. The plugin should also work fine with Dimensions CM version 12.x. If you need support for an older version of Dimensions CM, then older versions of the Jenkins Dimensions Plugin are available to download and install (for example, version 0.8.15 should work with Dimensions CM 2009 R1 and 2009 R2). The plugin uses the Dimensions CM Java client API to communicate with a specified Dimensions CM server installation and so requires that the Jenkins installation be updated with a number of JAR files from the Dimensions CM installation as documented below.</p><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-Installation">Installation</h1><p>To add this plugin to a Jenkins installation, the following steps need to be taken:</p><ul><li>The plugin needs to be installed and enabled using the Jenkins plugin manager from the <em>Available</em> tab in the usual manner. The name of the Dimensions CM plugin to select and install is <em>Dimensions Plugin</em>.</li><li>The following Dimensions Java client API JAR files need to be added to the user class path for the Jenkins JVM, or dropped into the <em>&lt;JENKINS_HOME&gt;</em><code>/plugins/dimensionsscm/WEB-INF/lib</code> directory. These JAR files can be copied from the <em>&lt;DM_ROOT&gt;</em><code>/java_api/lib/</code> or <em>&lt;DM_ROOT&gt;</em><code>/AdminConsole/lib/</code> directory of your Dimensions server or client installation respectively.<ul><li><code>darius.jar</code></li><li><code>dmclient.jar</code></li><li><code>dmfile.jar</code></li><li><code>dmnet.jar</code></li></ul></li><li><p>Depending on the version of the Dimensions Java client API you are using, there may be some additional JAR files needed (e.g. <code>commons-logging-api.jar</code> for CM 12.2 or 14.1; and <code>slf4j-api.jar</code> for CM 14.3). You should copy these too.</p></li></ul><p>Failure to follow the above steps will mean the plugin will not operate correctly.</p><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-ConfiguringthePlugin">Configuring the Plugin</h1><p>The plugin can be configured to work with Dimensions at both the System level and at the individual job definition level.</p><h3 id="DimensionsPlugin-SystemConfiguration">System Configuration</h3><p>Configuring the plugin at the system level allows you to define a default Dimensions installation which can be used as the default for every job. This default installation can be configured by opening the <em>Manage Jenkins-&gt;Configure system</em> configuration page and looking for the Dimensions configuration pane shown below.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-DimensionsLoginDetails">Dimensions Login Details</h5><p>The standard Dimensions login details need to be provided in the above fields. This is the Dimensions login that will be used by Jenkins to connect to the Dimensions repository and retrieve any updated files. A <em>Check Connection...</em> button is provided for your convenience to ensure the connection details you have specified are correct and can be used by Jenkins.</p><hr/><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/41878092/42631174.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/41878092/42631174.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="42631174" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="HudsonSystemConfig.JPG" data-base-url="https://wiki.jenkins.io" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="41878092" data-linked-resource-container-version="160"></span></p><hr/><p>Checking the <em>Use update</em> toggle will get the plugin to automatically populate your Jenkins workspace with content from Dimensions. If the checkbox is not selected, then the plugin will not automatically populate your workspace.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-AdvancedOptions">Advanced Options</h5><p>The <em>Advanced...</em> tag shown below allows you to specify if the Dimensions server installation is running in a different time zone than the current Jenkins installation. This is useful if you are running in a geographically distributed environment.</p><hr/><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/41878092/42631177.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/41878092/42631177.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="42631177" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="DimensionsPluginAdvancedTabSmall.JPG" data-base-url="https://wiki.jenkins.io" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="41878092" data-linked-resource-container-version="160"></span></p><hr/><p>The <em>Advanced...</em> tag also allows you to specify an optional Dimensions Web client installation that can be used to directly access files in Dimensions to perform Dimensions operations on them via the Web client.</p><h3 id="DimensionsPlugin-JobConfiguration">Job Configuration</h3><p>When you create a new Jenkins job, you need to configure the Dimensions stream or project that this job will be monitoring. This can be done using the standard job <em>Configure</em>. page.</p><p>Using the <em>Source Code Management</em> pane, select the Dimensions option and fill in the details shown below with the Dimensions project that this job will use.</p><hr/><p><span class="confluence-embedded-file-wrapper"><img class="confluence-embedded-image" src="attachments/41878092/42631245.jpg" data-image-src="attachments/41878092/42631245.jpg" data-unresolved-comment-count="0" data-linked-resource-id="42631245" data-linked-resource-version="1" data-linked-resource-type="attachment" data-linked-resource-default-alias="HudsonDimensionsJobMD.jpg" data-base-url="https://wiki.jenkins.io" data-linked-resource-content-type="image/jpeg" data-linked-resource-container-id="41878092" data-linked-resource-container-version="160"></span></p><hr/><p>The <em>Project Name</em> must refer to the Dimensions project or stream that this job will monitor. This is a mandatory field.</p><p>The <em>Folder Name</em> refers to a specific folder name in the Dimensions project or stream that the job can monitor. This should be specified in UNIX format and represent the high-level folder from which files will be monitored. If you leave this field blank or specify '/', then all the contents of the project/stream will be monitored. You can specify multiple folders to monitor or just leave it blank to monitor everything.</p><p>The <em>Workspace Location</em> specifies a particular workspace location to which Dimensions will put any updated files. If this field is left blank, then the default Jenkins-provided workspace will be used. (<em>Note:</em> As of release 0.7.7, this option has been removed from the GUI and is now ignored. You can configure a custom workspace location using the Jenkins <strong>Advanced Project Options</strong>).</p><p>A number of options are provided that can be used to control the behavior of the plugin. These are:</p><ul><li>Clear the contents of the workspace – checking this option will delete the full contents of the workspace before using Dimensions to repopulate it. The use of this option is not recommended for very large projects as it can significantly increase the build time</li><li>Always force a build to occur – checking this option will ignore any errors or file conflicts reported by the plugin and always force the build to be started. If this option is not selected, then any errors or conflicts reported by the plugin will automatically abort the build.</li><li>Overwrite any locally modified files in workspace – checking this option will automatically overwrite any files that may have been modified in the local workspace with files that come from Dimensions. The use of this option is not recommended if you are using Jenkins to build workspaces that have content that might conflict with that stored in the Dimensions repository.</li></ul><p>An <em>Advanced...</em> tag allows you to override any of the default Dimensions installation details specified in the system configuration. The options provided are the same as document in the <em>System Configuration</em> section above. Options are also provided to control the permissions on files that are checked out into the Jenkins workspace and specify if item header substitution is to be used.</p><h4 id="DimensionsPlugin-JobBuildOptions">Job Build Options</h4><p>In version 0.6 onwards of the plugin, enhanced support has been added for release builds that provide tighter control over the content that goes into a Jenkins build. Options have been added that allow you to:</p><ul><li>Lock a project or stream while a build is in progress</li><li><em>Tag</em> a successful build such that a baseline is automatically created in the Dimensions repository on build completion</li><li>Use a parameterized build to specify a baseline to build, rather than a project</li><li>Use a parameterized build to specify a list of requests to build, rather than a project.</li></ul><p>These options are described in the following sections below.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-LockingaProjectwhileabuildisrunning">Locking a Project while a build is running</h5><p>It is now possible to lock a Dimensions project or stream while a build is being run, such that no changes maybe made to that project (or stream) until the build has finished. This option is provided so that long running builds can be assured that the state of the Dimensions project that they are building does not change while the build is in progress. This option should be set if the build process interacts with Dimensions once the initial checkout is complete and the state of the project needs to be consistent with the assets being built.</p><p>An example of this might be if the build process does a deployment or release step from Dimensions as part of the build.</p><p>This option can be enabled or disabled via the <em>Lock Dimensions project while the build is in progress</em> flag under the <strong>Build Environment</strong> options.</p><p><em>(Note</em> - This option must be set if you intend to tag a successful build. Failure to do so will automatically fail that build).</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-TaggingaSuccessfulbuildinDimensions">Tagging a Successful build in Dimensions</h5><p>It is now possible to <em>tag</em> a successful build in Dimensions, such that a baseline is automatically created to represent the state of the project or stream that was just built. This option is provided so that release or checkpoint builds can automatically be tagged in Dimensions to have an asset that represents that build.</p><p>This option can be enabled or disabled via the <em>Tag successful builds in Dimensions as a baseline</em> flag under the <strong>Post-build Actions</strong> options.</p><p>An <em>Advanced...</em> tag is present that allows you to change the type of baseline that is created by the tagging process. By default, the tagging process will create a project baseline, but support is also present for creating template driven baselines as well. The options that are currently supported are:</p><ul><li>Owning baseline part - This is the name of the Dimensions part that will own the baseline</li><li>Baseline template - This is the name of the baseline template which will be used to create the baseline. Currently, only item templates are supported. Other template types maybe added in a future release.</li><li>Baseline Scope - This states the type of baseline to be created - either a part scoped, project scoped or revised baseline. Currently, you should only use baseline templates and owning parts with part scoped baselines. Project driven baselines do not support templates or owning parts and specifying these options will be ignored by the plugin. Revised baselines will only work if you have setup your build to be parameterized and provide <em>DM_BASELINE</em> and <em>DM_TARGET_REQUEST</em> as input into the build. <em>DM_BASELINE</em> will be used as the source baseline and <em>DM_TARGET_REQUEST</em> will be used as the list of requests that are used to create the new revised baseline.</li><li>Baseline Type - This is the name of the user defined baseline type against which the baseline will be created. The default is baseline.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-UsingParameterizedBuilds">Using Parameterized Builds</h5><p>It is now possible to use a Jenkins build project to build both baselines and requests using parameters that are provided to each build when it is being run. This functionality has been added to allow a common build configuration to be used for repeated release and patch type builds if necessary, rather than using a named project which may also contain other unwanted changes. This functionality can be enabled by adding the following parameters to a Jenkins project using the <em>This build is parameterized</em> option:</p><ul><li><em>DM_BASELINE</em> - this string parameter will allow you to specify a Dimensions baseline which will be used as the source for the build, rather than the usual project. Specifying this option will override any project sources that might have been defined, all other options however will be honored as per usual. This option should be used if you intend to perform a release build from a known baseline of code.</li></ul><ul><li><em>DM_REQUEST</em> - this string parameter will allow you to specify a list of Dimensions requests (comma separated) which will be used as the source for the build, rather than the usual project. Specifying this option will override any project or baseline sources that might have been defined, all other options however - with the exception of folder filters - will be honored as per usual. This option should be used if you intend to apply a patch or list of patches to an existing area or are building specific controlled features that have been controlled by requests. Dependency relationships between requests will automatically be processed and any child requests be included in the build. When using this option, the Dimensions project specified in the job configuration will be used to select those <em>in-response-to</em> items that are relevant. If a request has changed files related to it that are not in the Dimensions project, then these changes will be ignored. <strong>Note</strong> - If you are using this functionality against a Dimensions 10.1.3 server, then the functionality that is offered by this parameter is limited to the capabilities present in Dimensions 10.1.3. For example, refactoring support is not offered, files will always be checked out as read-only and if you specify multiple requests to process, then each request will be checked out separately which might cause file versions to conflict with each other. If you wish to use this functionality, it is strongly suggested that you upgrade to Dimensions 2009 R1+.</li></ul><ul><li><em>DM_TARGET_REQUEST</em> - this string parameter will allow you to specify a list of Dimensions requests (comma separated) which will be used to relate any assets against that get checked into Dimensions as a result of a build. This refers primarily to build steps that use Dimensions Builder and post build actions such as building a tagged baseline and loading assets into Dimensions.</li></ul><h4 id="DimensionsPlugin-OtherJobBuildOptions">Other Job Build Options</h4><p>This section lists other build options that are available in this plugin.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-DeployingTaggedBaselinesinDimensions">Deploying Tagged Baselines in Dimensions</h5><p>It is now possible to automatically deploy a tagged baseline from the plugin as the last stage of the Jenkins build process. This will initiate a deployment of the contents of the baseline to all the deployment nodes associated with a deployment stage and the running of any deployment pre/post scripts. The plugin does this by running the Deploy Baseline command (DPB) and returning any results that this command generates.</p><p>This option can be enabled or disabled via the <em>Automatically deploy the baseline</em> flag under the <strong>Post-build Actions</strong> options. This option will only be presented if the <em>Tag successful builds in Dimensions as a baseline</em> flag is checked. You will also be able to specify the stage you want the baseline to be deployed to. If you do not specify a stage, then the next one will be used automatically.</p><p>(Note - For the deployment to succeed the project being used as a source for the build must be configured to allow baseline deployment).</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-ActioningTaggedBaselinesinDimensions">Actioning Tagged Baselines in Dimensions</h5><p>It is now possible to automatically action a tagged baseline from the plugin as the last stage of the Jenkins build process. This will action the tagged baseline to a given lifecycle state in Dimensions. The plugin does this by running the Action Baseline command (ABL) and returning any results that this command generates.</p><p>This option can be enabled or disabled via the <em>Automatically action the baseline</em> flag under the <strong>Post-build Actions</strong> options. This option will only be presented if the <em>Tag successful builds in Dimensions as a baseline</em> flag is checked. You will also be able to specify the lifecycle state you want the baseline to be actioned to. If you do not specify a state, then the next one will be used automatically.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-LaunchingDimensionBuilderwithTaggedBaselines">Launching Dimension Builder with Tagged Baselines</h5><p>It is now possible to automatically launch a build in Dimensions Builder using the tagged baseline as part of the last stage of the Jenkins build process. This will initiate a baseline build in Dimensions Builder using build parameters setup in the Jenkins job configuration. The plugin does this by running the Build Baseline command (BLDB) and returning any results that this command generates.</p><p>This option can be enabled or disabled via the <em>Automatically build the baseline</em> flag under the <strong>Post-build Actions</strong> options. This option will only be presented if the <em>Tag successful builds in Dimensions as a baseline</em> flag is checked. You are also able to specify:</p><ul><li>the Dimensions Build area you want to use</li><li>the Dimensions Build configuration to use</li><li>the Dimensions Build options</li><li>the Dimensions Build targets</li><li>if to run the build in background mode</li><li>if to perform a clean build</li><li>if to capture build outputs and build dependencies under Dimensions.</li></ul><p>This option should be selected if you want to use Dimensions Builder within your build process. For example, to perform multi-platform release builds for the tagged baseline under strict Dimensions control.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-SavingBuildArtifactsintoDimensions">Saving Build Artifacts into Dimensions</h5><p>It is now possible to save assets that have been created as a result of a build process into Dimensions. This option can be enabled or disabled via the <em>Load any build artifacts into the Dimensions repository</em> flag under the <strong>Post-build Actions</strong> options.</p><p>Artifacts which have been identified for loading into Dimensions will then be put into the project that the plugin is monitoring using DELIVER or UPLOAD command as appropriate. If you specify files that are already under control and have not changed, then these files will be ignored. If you wish to specify a request to save these changes against, then you should set a project default request using SCWS or use DM_TARGET_REQUEST as commented on above.</p><p>In version 0.6.8 of the plugin onwards, you can specify the following advanced options when checking in a file</p><ul><li>Force files to be checked onto the tip - This will force uncontrolled files with the same name as existing Dimensions files to be loaded into the repository and placed onto the tip even if they are completely unrelated to files already present</li><li>Force files to be recorded as merged - This will force files which might contain revision conflicts to be loaded into the repository and recorded as being merged even though no physical code merge has taken place</li><li>Owning part for files - this will put all new files under the Dimensions part specified.</li></ul><p>This setting can be configured in the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab of the job configuration.</p><p><strong>Regular Expressions</strong></p><p>Activating this checkbox will give you the opportunity to enter a series of Java style regular expression patterns that will be used to determine which files in your workspace you want to consider for saving into Dimensions. For example, patterns like</p><ul><li><em>.*\.obj</em> - will consider all <code>.obj</code> files in any subfolder below the workspace</li><li><em>.*\.h</em> - will consider all <code>.h</code> files in any subfolder below the workspace</li><li><em>src/.*\.h</em> - will consider all <code>.h</code> files in the <code>src/</code> subdirectory below the workspace (this regular expression will only match such files on UNIX machines)</li></ul><p>All file and subdirectory patterns specified should be made relative to the workspace root. For example, if your workspace root is <code>/usr/jenkins/project/build/</code> and you want to save files from <code>/usr/jenkins/project/build/src/include</code>, then specify a pattern like <em>src/include/.*\.h</em> (this regular expression will only match such files on UNIX machines).</p><p>Regular expressions for uploading artifacts should use a directory separator character appropriate for the operating system of the machine where the workspace is located. If the workspace is on a Windows machine then <code>\</code> is the directory separator character (not <code>/</code>), but <em>\</em> is also the escape character in regular expressions, so you will need to double up the backslash in your regular expression (like <em>\\</em>) to match a single <code>\</code> directory separator.</p><p>Alternatively you can use the sub-pattern <em>[/\\]</em> to match either the <code>\</code> or <code>/</code> directory separator character. For example, <em>src[/\\]include[/\\].*\.h</em> means all <code>.h</code> files under the <code>src\include\</code> or <code>src/include/</code> directory in the workspace (so will work on both UNIX and Windows machines); and <em>(.+[/\\])?test[/\\]helloworld\.dat</em> means the file <code>helloworld.dat</code> in a subdirectory named <code>test</code> somewhere in the workspace (on either UNIX or Windows). Regular expression matching is very powerful, but can also be very complicated to use correctly, so do find some good <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">documentation</a> and maybe an online regular expression testing tool to check that they actually match the files you expect them to.</p><p><strong>Ant-Style Pattern Matches</strong></p><p>In version 0.8.5 of the plugin onwards, you also have the option to use Ant-style pattern matches for saving assets to Dimensions. As with the Java style regular expressions, this option allows you to enter a number of patterns based on Ant-style pattern matches. Ant-style patterns can be considerably easier to use correctly than regular expressions (and handle differences in directory separator characters on different operating systems for you).</p><p><strong>Inclusion and Exclusion Patterns</strong></p><p>As of version 0.8.6 of the plugin onwards, you can now also specify file exclusions as well as inclusions to apply to the files selected for upload.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-SpecifyingDimensionsRequeststoCaptureUploadedArtifactsorBuildAssets">Specifying Dimensions Requests to Capture Uploaded Artifacts or Build Assets</h5><p>If you are loading build artifacts into Dimensions using the <em>Load any build artifacts into the Dimensions repository</em> or <em>Automatically build the baseline</em> options and want to specify Dimensions requests against which to capture these changes, you can now do so by defining a Jenkins build parameter called DM_TARGET_REQUEST. When you then start a build, populate this parameter with the comma separated list of requests that you wish to use and these will be passed on to the appropriate Dimensions commands.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-SpecifyingPermissionsofCheckedFiles">Specifying Permissions of Checked Files</h5><p>In version 0.6.8 of the plugin onwards, it is possible to specify the permissions of the files which are being checked out as part of the job configuration. This includes</p><ul><li>Default permissions - the file's default permissions stored in Dimensions</li><li>Read-only - setting all the files to read only</li><li>Writeable - setting all the files to writeable.</li></ul><p>This setting can be configured in the <strong>Advanced</strong> tab of the job configuration.</p><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-DistributedBuildSupport">Distributed Build Support</h1><p>In version 0.6.7 onwards of the plugin, support has been added for using the distributed build facilities within Jenkins. There are two main capabilities that the plugin provides which can potentially be run on a remote node. These are</p><ul><li>Checking files out of the project/stream being monitored into a workspace, and</li><li>Checking files into the project/stream being monitored from the workspace</li></ul><p>To use these distributed capabilities, each remote Jenkins node must have a Dimensions client installation available and in the path. The remote Jenkins support is provided through <em>dmcli</em>, so that remote node must be a platform against which Dimensions is natively supported. If you wish to run Jenkins on an unsupported platform - such as Mac OS - then you can only use that platform as a master node. The master node support is Java based, so as long as that platform supports Java (and Jenkins), it should work. However, running the plugin on an unsupported platform in this way is purely at your own risk. No responsibility is taken or implied about how the plugin will behave in these conditions.</p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Securitylimitations">Security limitations</h5><p>If you run in a secure environment, then you need to be aware of one current limitation which is present in the plugin for distributed support. As the plugin is using <em>dmcli</em> on the slave to run Dimensions commands, the login details of the Dimensions user configured in the build job are temporarily written to a parameter file on the slave which is then used to run Dimensions commands. This parameter file is persisted until the job finishes. The location of this parameter file is displayed as the build progresses, so a knowledgeable individual with access to the slave could access this file whilst the job is in progress and obtain these login credentials. If this is a security concern, then it is advised that either:-</p><ul><li>you make the slave machine user's default temporary-file directory inaccessible to unauthorized users</li><li>configure the Dimensions user referenced in the job to have a very limited set of privileges, or</li><li>run the build on the master only</li></ul><p>This limitation is resolved in version 0.7.1 of the plugin.</p><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1><ul><li>The plugin should work against Dimensions 10 servers, but requires Dimensions Java client API JAR files from a Dimensions 2009 R1 server installation to work correctly. Otherwise you should use Dimensions Java client API JAR files from the same version of Dimensions as your Dimensions server installation.</li><li>Upgrading between certain plugin versions may give an error like <em>FATAL: Unable to run checkout callout - null</em> when running a job. If this happens, open the job configuration and save it again to resolve the issue.</li><li>Dimensions operations must be run by a user who has the necessary privileges to do that operation. If a user does not have the necessary privileges, then the Dimensions operation will fail as one would expect.</li><li>Loading build artifacts into Dimensions will not process controlled files which have been deleted, i.e. the deleted files will not be removed from the repository.</li><li>Upgrading to 0.8.5 of the plugin means you will <em>have to</em> reconfigure any plugin which uses the check-in functionality. <strong>Failure to do so will lead to the check-in feature either failing or being ignored.</strong></li><li>Specifying a reg-ex pattern &quot;.*&quot; (the default) may not filter out all the Dimensions metadata and .dm directories that it should. This is a bug which has been around a for a while, but only seems to surface occasionally. When using the regex option, it would be best to be very specific in the artifacts that you wish to check in.</li><li>To use Serena SSO to authenticate interactive users logging into Jenkins, protect the Jenkins application in your deployment container (e.g. Tomcat) and use Jenkins' <em>Delegate to servlet container</em> authentication model. Polling and updating by the Dimensions Plugin will still use the user account configured as the <em>Login Name</em> and <em>Password</em> in the <em>Advanced</em> view of the <strong>Source Code Management</strong> section.</li><li>Jenkins 2.9 - 2.11 are affected by <em>JENKINS-35906</em> (causes <code>java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Failed to instantiate class hudson.scm.SCM</code>). Workaround is to upgrade to Jenkins 2.12 or later.</li></ul><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-Possiblefuturechanges">Possible future changes</h1><p>The following are a list of possible future changes to the plugin</p><ul><li>Documentation: Update the wiki with new screen dumps for improved options and document best practices</li><li>Enhancement: Code diff'ing from the change logs</li><li>Enhancement: Timeout on job polling</li><li>Bugfix: Change-set generation to handle HTTPS</li><li>Enhancement: Upload artifacts to support requests</li></ul><h1 id="DimensionsPlugin-Changelog">Changelog</h1><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.16(Nov19,2018)">Version 0.8.16 (Nov 19, 2018)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Baseline names generated using <code>[CURRENT_DATE]</code> were no longer legal in Dimensions CM 14.4, so changed colon separators to period characters. If you rely on the format of the baseline name including these (now invalid) colon characters you can revert to the old behavior by setting a system property (L3R08939)</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.15(Sep13,2018)">Version 0.8.15 (Sep 13, 2018)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Passwords were stored in configuration files with a straightforward reversible encoding - it is now encrypted with Jenkins' own encryption (SECURITY-1065).</li><li>Bugfix: The validation on the configuration form was vulnerable to CSRF and didn't check Jenkins permissions appropriately (SECURITY-1108).</li><li>Upgrading to this version of the plugin, in order to get both of these security fixes, is recommended for all users.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.14(May3,2018)">Version 0.8.14 (May 3, 2018)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Implemented small number of more recent SCM methods to improve compatibility with other Jenkins plugins (JENKINS-44583).</li><li>Enhancement: Added MIT-licensed source for stub version of the Java API, so Jenkins.io CI infrastructure can be used (also plugin code is now licensed with simple standard MIT license)..</li><li>Bugfix: Post-build baseline operations should change the build state (JENKINS-32268).</li><li>Bugfix: Minor UI changes to make default repository behavior more understandable.</li><li>Bugfix: Users without privilege to fetch request detailed descriptions can run request-based builds (JENKINS-48645).</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.13(Jan26,2016)">Version 0.8.13 (Jan 26, 2016)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Improved diagnostics for missing JARs and for various error conditions involving slaves (IOExceptions or inability to locate dmcli).</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.12(May14,2015)">Version 0.8.12 (May 14, 2015)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: <em>Check Connection</em> button (in Configure pages) could fail to connect with a <code>NullPointerException</code> in some environments.</li><li>Enhancement: Reduced warnings in the System Log by not calling deprecated Jenkins APIs and better diagnostic messages when things go wrong.</li><li>Enhancement: Improved handling of non-ASCII filenames in changelogs.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.11(Mar25,2015)">Version 0.8.11 (Mar 25, 2015)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Reconfiguring a job to use Ant patterns for the upload artifacts post-build action failed in Jenkins 1.596 and later (no need for this update unless you have this issue).</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.10(Mar23,2015)">Version 0.8.10 (Mar 23, 2015)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Regular expression pattern-matching for upload of build artifacts was no longer using the full workspace-relative path, but just the filename component of the path; the full workspace-relative path is now used again.</li><li>Enhancement: The plugin now uses the Jenkins System log for debug-logging, and the logging and build output should include better detail about the reasons for any problem than in previous releases.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.9(Dec10,2014)">Version 0.8.9 (Dec 10, 2014)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Can exclude file path patterns from being monitored for changes (for example, useful for built artifacts). Changes to excluded file patterns won't trigger a build, but will still be shown and updated when a build is eventually started by some subsequent change. The patterns to exclude are Ant-style patterns using <code>/</code> as a separator (even on Windows). For example, <code>**/target/**</code> would ignore changes in any <code>target</code> directory in the repository, and <code>**/*.class</code> would ignore changes to any <code>.class</code> files in the repository.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.8(Oct29,2014)">Version 0.8.8 (Oct 29, 2014)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Using check out and then check in on projects could lead to missed modifications during polling in particular circumstances.</li><li>Bugfix: It was possible for unwanted content to appear in config.xml; this should no longer occur.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.6(Jan31,2014)">Version 0.8.6 (Jan 31, 2014)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Checking in artifacts now supports exclusion patterns as well as inclusion patterns.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.5(Dec25,2013)">Version 0.8.5 (Dec 25, 2013)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Checking in artifacts now supports filtering by Ant-style patterns as well as regular expressions.</li></ul><p><em>Warning: Upgrading to this version means you will have to reconfigure any job which uses the check in artifact functionality.</em><br/> <em>Failure to do so will end up with the checkin either failing or being ignored.</em></p><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.3.1(Nov25,2013)">Version 0.8.3.1 (Nov 25, 2013)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Minor bug fixes, Dimensions compatibility enhancements, improved multithreading support.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.8.1(Mar9,2011)">Version 0.8.1 (Mar 9, 2011)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Incorporate fix for copying Dimensions plugin information around between jobs.</li><li>Enhancement: Support for NOTOUCH option.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.7.11(Mar2,2011)">Version 0.7.11 (Mar 2, 2011)</h5><ul><li>Bugfix: Compatibility issues with 1.391+.</li><li>Enhancement: Support for Dimensions 12.1.x.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.7.9(Dec28,2010)">Version 0.7.9 (Dec 28, 2010)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Add <em>DM_BASELINE</em> to the baseline identifier template pattern.</li><li>Enhancement: Incorporate EOL changes.</li><li>Enhancement: Polling to support 1.345+.</li><li>Enhancement: Upgrade Hudson architecture support to latest version.</li><li>Bugfix/Enhancement: Allow slave processing to also be run on the master.</li><li>Bugfix: Correct command handling on Unix slaves for checkout/checkin tasks, e.g. /TMP invalid qualifier error.</li></ul><h5 id="DimensionsPlugin-Version0.7.7(May22,2010)">Version 0.7.7 (May 22, 2010)</h5><ul><li>Enhancement: Remove <em>Workspace location</em> text box.
