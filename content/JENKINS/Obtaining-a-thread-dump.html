                    <p>During the trouble-shooting of Jenkins, we often request that you obtain thread dumps of relevant Java VMs. Thread dumps concisely captures what every thread in a VM is doing at a given point in time, and therefore it is useful to diagnose hang problems, deadlocks, and performance issues. This page explains how you obtain it.</p>

<h1 id="Obtainingathreaddump-FromJenkinsWebUI">From Jenkins Web UI</h1>

<p>This is the simplest way of obtaining thread dumps.</p>

<p>If Jenkins or its build agents are operating normally, you can obtain a thread dump remotely by going to <code><a href="http://your.jenkins.server/threadDump" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://your.jenkins.server/threadDump</a></code>. For an agent named 'xyz', go to <code><a href="http://your.jenkins.server/computer/xyz/systemInfo" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://your.jenkins.server/computer/xyz/systemInfo</a></code>. You need to have the administrator permission on the system.</p>

<h1 id="Obtainingathreaddump-Byusingjstack">By using <code>jstack</code></h1>

<p>If Jenkins is not responding to web UI, try <a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/share/jstack.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">jstack</a> to obtain the thread dump. For one reason or another that none of us quite understand well, one might have to add -F to get the dump. If that was the case, please mention that in the report as well.</p>

<p>Make sure to run jstack as the same user that's running Jenkins itself instead of using the root user</p>


<p><code>jstack</code> isn't always reliable, and sometimes it fails to obtain thread dumps for no obvious reasons.</p>

<h1 id="Obtainingathreaddump-Bysendingsignal">By sending signal</h1>

<p>If the above two approaches do not work, you can still have the JVM print the thread dump to its stdout by sending it a signal.</p>

<p>If you have a terminal or command prompt that's running the JVM, you can hit Ctrl+
<br class="atl-forced-newline"/>
(Unix) or Ctrl+Break (Windows) to do this. If the JVM is running in background, you do this by <code>kill -3 PID</code> (Unix) or use <a href="http://www.latenighthacking.com/projects/2003/sendsignal/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">a tool like this</a> to send a signal (Windows).</p>

<p>Obviously, you must be on the same machine as the Jenkins master when you run this command. In a situation like this, the standard output of JVM is normally redirected to a log file, so you need to hunt down where it is written to and pick up the dump from there. On Unix, you can look at <code>/proc/PID/fd/1</code> to figure out which file the stdout is being written to. On Windows, if you have <a href="Installing-Jenkins-as-a-Windows-service.html">installed Jenkins as a Windows service</a>, check that page for whereabouts of the log files.</p>

<p>This approach is platform specific, but it tends to be more reliable even when JVM is in a dire state.</p>
