<p>This plugin add browser axis to matrix job<br/>
This plugin serves selenim tests, it create labels for browsers of slave and sets a build variable which contains path to the browser's binary file.</p>

<h2 id="Browseraxisplugin-Settingsofbrowsers"><span style="color: rgb(51,102,255);"><strong>Settings of browsers</strong></span></h2>

<p>Browsers can be set in global Jenkins configuration Manage Jenkins -&gt; Configure System</p>

<p>There could be set browser types like Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera ..</p>

<p>Each type can use suffixes - one for Windows slaves and one for Unix slave. For Windows slaves is used suffix <em>.exe</em>, for Unix slaves is used suffix <em>-bin</em>, if its operating system is checked in suffix configuration for unix.</p>

<p>Each type of browser has two kind versions:</p>
<ul>
	<li>versions which are shared (the binary file is on shared resource which is same for all slaves) - path for a version must be same for all slaves, but it is possible to use system variables. </li>
	<li>versions of browsers which is locally installed in slaves - only one version for one slave.</li>
</ul>


<p><strong>Setting of shared versions</strong></p>

<p>There are name of version, for example Firefox-8 and path to the binary file. If the suffixes are used, path is without suffixes (suffixes will be added according to suffixes configuration). The system variables can be used in path.</p>

<p><strong>Setting of locally installed versions</strong></p>

<p>There are one setting for Unix slave and one for Windows slave. They are enabled by checked ..........  Both contains path to the binary file and command which return version of its installation.</p>

<p>These setting create label for all slaves which name is created from type of browser and version of this locally installed browser with suffix -auto, so for example it could be Firefox-5.2-auto.</p>


<h2 id="Browseraxisplugin-UsinginMatrixJobs">Using in Matrix Jobs</h2>

<p>For choosing suitable slave can be used Browser or Browser expression.</p>
<ul>
	<li>Browser is very similar to JDK. There are checkbox for each version, versions of locally installed browsers contain suffix -auto.</li>
	<li>Browser expression is similar to Label expression, but it is only for determining the browsers more commonly</li>
</ul>


<p>When the build of job stars, the plugin will create variable BROWSER_AXIS_PATH which contains path to the browser's binary file and add this path to the variable PATH. If there was used Browser expression, the chosen will be the first browse which is find in slave, on which this job is building.</p>
