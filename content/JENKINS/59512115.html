<h1 id="samplenewCollabnetwiki(draft)-FAQ:">FAQ:</h1>

<p>   1.  Does this integrate with / update the <a href="SFEE-Plugin.html">SFEE Plugin</a>?</p>

<p>        No, the <a href="SFEE-Plugin.html">SFEE Plugin</a> is a separate plugin that is not maintained by <a href="http://www.collab.net" title="CollabNet" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">CollabNet</a>.  It works with CollabNet SourceForge 4.4, so it may be a good choice if you have an older version.  Our plugin is not a direct upgrade.  If you change from using the <a href="SFEE-Plugin.html">SFEE Plugin</a> to the CollabNet Plugin, you will have to reconfigure your jobs appropriately.  You should be able to use both plugins simultaneously, if you wish, although it might be a bit confusing.</p>

<p>   2.  Uploads fail when using an SSL-enabled TeamForge server.  What do I do?</p>

<p>        You'll need to add the server's certificate to your java keystore on the Jenkins server.  First dowload the certificate to your Jenkins server.  You should be able to get it by opening a browser window on the TeamForge server, viewing the certificate associated with that page, and exporting the certificate file.  Then, you'll need to run something like &quot;sudo keytool -keystore $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/cacerts -import -file teamforge.cert&quot;.  (On Windows, replace $JAVA_HOME with %JAVA_HOME%).  If you haven't changed your java keystore's password, it will be &quot;changeit&quot;.  After you've imported the cert to the java instance that Jenkins is using, it should be able to upload.</p>

<p>   3.  I'm having problems with login and logout when using CollabNet Authentication.  It seems to be redirecting to an unexpected site.</p>

<p>        Go to the Jenkins configure page and look in the Email Notifacation section.  The CollabNet plugin uses the value of the Jenkins URL set here for redirection.  If it's wrong, logins will go astray.  Check that it's set to the real Jenkins URL.</p>

<p>   4.  I've setup authentication, but can no longer get to the &quot;Manage Jenkins&quot; pages.&amp;nbps; How do I get back into the system?</p>

<p>        As long as you have access to the machine and user running Jenkins, you'll be able to get back in.  Just log into the machine.  Find the Jenkins home (by default, this will be the ~/.jenkins or ~/.hudson directory of the user running Jenkins).  Edit the config.xml, changing the value for &quot;useSecurity&quot; to false.  Restart Jenkins and you should not need to log in to get access.</p>
