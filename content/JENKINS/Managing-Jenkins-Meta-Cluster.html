                    <p>This document discusses how to programmatically create and maintain a Jenkins instance (which is normally done by an administrator in a typical single-deployment scenario.) This is for a large organization that needs to manage a large number of Jenkins installations, or perhaps a hosting environment that provides Jenkins as a service.</p>

<h2 id="ManagingJenkinsMeta-Cluster-Installinganewinstance">Installing a new instance</h2>
<p>Installing a new instance of Jenkins is just a matter of deploying Jenkins into an application server, so much of the automation depends on the container of your choice. You can also choose to run Jenkins as &quot;<code>java -jar jenkins.war</code>&quot; and use embedded Winstone, although the scalability of Winstone hasn't been widely tried yet.</p>

<p>The only information Jenkins needs when launching is <code>JENKINS_HOME</code> â€” a directory that Jenkins uses to store all the data. See <a href="Administering-Jenkins.html">Administering Jenkins</a> for how to pass in this information. You can programmatically create such a directory and fill it with the data files to start Jenkins in a pre-configured state that fits your environment. The easiest way to do this is to run Jenkins once manually and configure it to a desired state, and grab its data file as a template. You should also be able to just look at the files and figure out what they mean.</p>
