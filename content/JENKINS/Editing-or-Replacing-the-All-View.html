                    <h3 id="EditingorReplacingtheAllView-Whycan&#39;tIeditthe&quot;All&quot;view?">Why can't I edit the &quot;All&quot; view?</h3>

<p>This is because it is of type &quot;All&quot; not of type &quot;List&quot;, and the &quot;All&quot; type is not editable.  You can only have one view of type &quot;All&quot;.</p>

<p>If you want to edit this view, you will have to create a new view instead.  See other questions on this page for more information.</p>

<h3 id="EditingorReplacingtheAllView-Whycan&#39;tIdeletethe&quot;All&quot;view?">Why can't I delete the &quot;All&quot; view?</h3>

<p>This is because it is set as your default view.  To delete this view, go to &quot;Manage Jenkins&quot; &gt; &quot;Configure System&quot; and change the selection in the &quot;Default View&quot; drop-down.<br/>
You can't change the default view unless you already have another view created.  Once you have changed to a new default view, you can delete the &quot;All&quot; view.</p>

<h3 id="EditingorReplacingtheAllView-HowdoIdeletethe&quot;All&quot;viewin&quot;Myviews&quot;?">How do I delete the &quot;All&quot; view in &quot;My views&quot;?</h3>

<p>To delete this view, go to &quot;People&quot; &gt; &quot;<em>your username/userid</em>&quot; &gt; &quot;Configure&quot; and change the selection in the &quot;Default View&quot; text field (this should actually be a drop-down too!).<br/>
Just like the global default view, you can't delete a user's default view unless you already have another view created. Once you have changed to a new default view, you can delete the user's &quot;All&quot; view.</p>


<h3 id="EditingorReplacingtheAllView-HowcanIcreatean&quot;EditableAllView&quot;?">How can I create an &quot;Editable All View&quot;?</h3>

<p>You might want a view like &quot;All&quot; that shows all jobs, but perhaps you want to be able to change the columns around a bit.  To do this, you need to create a &quot;faux-All&quot; view, by following these steps.</p>

<ol>
	<li>Create your new view.  Give it a name like &quot;All2&quot;, and do not choose the type &quot;All&quot; if that option is available.  Choose &quot;List&quot; or some other option if you have other plugins installed.</li>
	<li>Find the checkbox labeled &quot;Use a regular expression to include jobs into the view&quot; and check it.</li>
	<li>Enter the regular expression &quot;.*&quot; to pick up all jobs (or use the <a href="View-Job-Filters.html#ViewJobFilters-ShowingAllJobswiththe&quot;AllJobs&quot;Filter">View Job Filters</a>)</li>
	<li>Configure the view in any other way you like.  For example, changing the columns you want to show.</li>
	<li>Save the new view</li>
	<li>Optionally, now you can replace your &quot;All&quot; view with your new view with the remaining steps</li>
	<li>Follow the instructions above for <a href="#EditingorReplacingtheAllView-Whycan'tIdeletethe&quot;All&quot;view?">Deleting the All view</a></li>
	<li>Rename your temporary &quot;All2&quot; view to &quot;All&quot; by clicking the &quot;Edit View&quot; link on the left of that view's page</li>
</ol>
