<ul>
	<li>A &quot;Save &amp; leave open&quot; button would be great.<br/>
When experimenting with jobs configs, I currently have 3 browser tabs open:
	<ol>
		<li>config editor</li>
		<li>job page, for just the Build button,</li>
		<li>console page.. Currently the Save button closes the editor, so have hit configure to go back to it straight away. (Gergo)</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>+1 to &quot;Save and Leave Open&quot; as a floating button (<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/mz0rJNTzqms/cZvQP7gfWb4J" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Didier Durand</a>)</li>

<h5 id="CompletedUIImprovements-Floating&quot;Save&quot;button(DONE)">Floating &quot;Save&quot; button (DONE)</h5>

<ul>
	<li>Would be very nice if some of the &quot;Save&quot; buttons &quot;floated&quot; as you scrolled the page<br/>
so you don't have to scroll all the way to the bottom of a very large config page to save something you changed at the top. (slide)
<blockquote><p>And I second Slide's proposal about floating &quot;Save&quot; button. (vladsed)</p></blockquote></li>
	<li>+1 to Slide-o-mix's idea about floating buttons. It would be even better if it could keep you on the page in the same location, as in &quot;save&quot; versus &quot;save and exit&quot;.<br/>
In particular, the job configuration and manage jenkins page could use something like this. (<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/mz0rJNTzqms/sCAqpDbNBlgJ" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Brian J</a>)</li>
	<li>+1 on floating save buttons (Ann Campell)</li>
	<li>+1 for fixing the save button, I don't care what method is used as long<br/>
as I can easily find it with out a lot of scrolling. (<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/mz0rJNTzqms/iIZxqaDb5z8J" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Mark Donohoe</a>)</li>
</ul>


<ul>
	<li>As said, with a lot of plugins the job configuration page can be very long. The save button is really far far away every time ! (Daniel PETISME)</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>This is why I thought a &quot;floating&quot; save button would be nice. In reality, something like the floating ToC in some Wiki implementations<br/>
might be nice to, so that you could quickly switch between different config sections, and have the save button handy. I think that Trac has the floating ToC option.<br/>
(slide)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Why are people so afraid of &lt;ctrl&gt;+&lt;end&gt; (works on Linux and Windows – surely Mac has an equivalent) <img class="emoticon emoticon-wink" src="images/icons/emoticons/wink.svg" data-emoticon-name="wink" alt="(wink)"/><br/>
Personally I find floating buttons annoying as they always end up getting in the way of something (which leads to more scrolling, subverting the original reason for it),<br/>
or grabbing focus when they shouldn’t.  I’m yet to see one done well, where a fixed button would have worked just as well. (telio) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>you can also click into an input field, and hit enter, at least this is what I'm doing, when I too lazy to scroll. (Ferenc Kovacs)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>That actually is a feature that I would like to get removed from Jenkins. It's always quite annoying for me to navigate to a field, select a value<br/>
from my Firefox auto-completion list using the RETURN key and then the dialog is closed automatically by Jenkins even though I want to continue editing <img class="emoticon emoticon-sad" src="images/icons/emoticons/sad.svg" data-emoticon-name="sad" alt="(sad)"/><br/>
I think having a shortcut like Jira (ALT-S) would be much better than changing the semantics of RETURN. (Ulli) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>If your cursor is within an input, this takes you to the end of the field, not the page.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt; It's always quite annoying for me to navigate to a field, select a value from my Firefox auto-completion list using the RETURN key<br/>
and then the dialog is closed automatically by Jenkins even though I want to continue editing.</p>

<p>This is standard web browser behaviour (RETURN/ENTER submits the form), and yes I agree it's very annoying. Some people think that the<br/>
standard behaviour should be overridden, others think you should not change standard behaviour.  (unknown) </p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>I don't think that this is a standard if you select from a drop down<br/>
list. It only is a standard if the text in the textbox has focus.<br/>
E.g. in Jira if you select from a drop down box with ENTER then the<br/>
selected value is chosen but the form is not closed.<br/>
Or in any login dialog (e.g., gmail), when selecting your user name from<br/>
the auto-completion in the user field then that value is copied to the<br/>
user field on RETURN. The form is not submitted with an empty password<br/>
if you press ENTER in the user auto-completion. (Ulli)</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>Chrome and Safari allow you to choose an auto-completion using return. Only if you press return twice, is the form submitted.<br/>
Maybe there is a bug in Firefox? Or you are not supposed to use return to choose from auto-completion list? (Sami)</p></blockquote>

<ul>
	<li>Certainly a keyboard shortcut would be nice for saving the config. If you have such a long config page that scrolling is an issue you could always do control f and search for save.

	<li>Many people seem to want a floating Save button for config page.<br/>
I myself always just hit enter or the key to jump to end of page.<br/>
But I'd appreciate a keyboard shortcut, like in Jira. (<a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/jenkinsci-users/mz0rJNTzqms/qDD5HWNpb-gJ" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Sami</a>)</li>
