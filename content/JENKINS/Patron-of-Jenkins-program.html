<h1 id="PatronofJenkinsprogram-Overallprogramstructure">Overall program structure</h1>

<p>We currently have a <a href="Donation.html">&quot;friend of Jenkins&quot;</a> program where we send a small thank-you plugin for donors of $25 or more.</p>

<p>This program defines another donation level, called &quot;Patron of Jenkins,&quot; for donations at or above $750. To show appreciation to patrons of Jenkins, we will allow them to display messages on our website in a non-obtrusive way.</p>


<h1 id="PatronofJenkinsprogram-Formatofthepatronmessage">Format of the patron message</h1>

<p>Patron messages get displayed in a format that closely resembles Google text ads. See <a href="http://jenkins-infra.github.io/patron/tester.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the tester application</a> for the exact dimension, size, layout, etc. The tester application also lets patrons play with different messages and see how they look.</p>

<p>All patron messages are subject to approval in <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the Jenkins project meeting</a>. The criteria for approval is for the messages to be relevant and supportive of Jenkins. For example, we don't want messages like &quot;Eradicate AIDS from Earth with Bill Gates&quot; or &quot;Donate to Wikipedia&quot; because these noble causes are not relevant to Jenkins, nor do we want &quot;Switch from Jenkins to XYZ&quot; because it is not supportive of Jenkins. Messages we'd like to see are, for example, messages about Jenkins books, services and products around Jenkins, bug bounties, etc.</p>


<h1 id="PatronofJenkinsprogram-Whereandwhentodisplaythepatronmessage">Where and when to display the patron message</h1>

<p>The patron messages will be shown at the top of the Wiki page, as in the <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Roadmap" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">codehaus wiki</a>, but not at the bottom.</p>

<p>Ad display also only happens for 1 in 7 requests. Based on Dec/Jan Wiki hit stats, we average about 1.4M+ total hits to the Wiki per month. So in total, ads will display on approximately 200,000 page loads (1/7th of 1.4M) – most likely more as the community continues to grow, but possibly less.</p>

<p>Patrons are encouraged to monitor the effectiveness of their ads using the tracking mechanism of their choice.</p>


<h1 id="PatronofJenkinsprogram-Patronslots&amp;impressionsperquarter">Patron slots &amp; impressions per quarter</h1>

<p>To increase diversity and to reduce administrative overhead, we have 4 available patron “slots” per quarter.  Each slot starts/ends at the quarter boundary (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec).</p>

<p>Since there will be about available 200,000 impressions total, each patron can expect about 50,000 impressions for their slot per month, or 150k total impressions per quarter. <em>For a given page view, each slot gets 1/7 x 1/4 = 1/28 chance of being selected.</em></p>

<p>A patron gets one slot for each $750 donation. Slot allocation is on a first come, first served basis, unless patrons want to sign up for slots in future quarters. See <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/patron/blob/gh-pages/messages.xml" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the current allocation of slots</a>.</p>

<p>If you are calculating the cost, it is approximately equal to $0.005 per impression. The donation level and the page impressions were calculated to match the banner pricing in the Eclipse foundation, which sells a 200px by 200px image ad for $2K at 400K hits/month bundle.</p>

<h1 id="PatronofJenkinsprogram-Process">Process</h1>

<ol>
	<li>If you are interested in becoming a patron, please drop us a note at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-patrons" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">jenkinsci-patrons@googlegroups.com</a>.</li>
	<li>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/patron/blob/gh-pages/messages.xml" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the current allocation of slots</a>, and make sure the availability matches with your expectation. We'll also confirm availability with you via email.</li>
	<li>Use <a href="http://jenkins-infra.github.io/patron/tester.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the tester application</a> to design messages you like. Please be considerate when designing patron messages, because if the community doesn't like what they are seeing, we may have to revisit/shutdown the program. That's not in anyone's interest.</li>
	<li>Once you are happy with messages, drop us a note at <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jenkinsci-patrons" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">jenkinsci-patrons@googlegroups.com</a> along with when you'd like them scheduled. We'll put it up for <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the next project meeting</a> for approval. Note that this meeting only happens once in two weeks. Please attend the meeting in which your messages get discussed.</li>
	<li>The project meeting will review messages and approve it.</li>
	<li><a href="https://co.clickandpledge.com/advanced/default.aspx?wid=46160" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Make a donation</a>, which is tax deductible. If you wish to use an American Express card, please use the <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/donations/alternate/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">SPI Alternate Site</a>.</li>
	<li>Once the board gets the donation confirmation from <a href="http://www.spi-inc.org/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">SPI</a> (which usually happens within 10 minutes or so after you complete the donation form), we'll integrate your messages to <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/patron/blob/gh-pages/messages.xml" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">the master record</a>. Your slots are committed at this point. We'll drop you an email and let you know.</li>
</ol>



<p>This is an honor system. There is no contract, no invoice, no paperwork except the receipt you get from SPI for your donation. If you don't trust us, this program is not for you.</p>

<h1 id="PatronofJenkinsprogram-Revisitingtheprogram">Revisiting the program</h1>

<p>At the end of March 2015, the program will be reviewed and changes might be made.</p>
