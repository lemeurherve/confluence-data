                    <p>Each new version of <code>jenkins.war</code> is released by the process described here.</p>

<h3 id="ReleaseProcess-Weeklyreleases">Weekly releases</h3>
<ul class="alternate">
	<li>Releases are made (roughly <a href="https://jenkins-ci.org/changelog" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">once per week</a>) from the <a href="https://github.com/jenkinsci/jenkins/tree/master" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">master branch</a>, (which is <a href="https://ci.jenkins-ci.org/job/jenkins_main_trunk/" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">built by Jenkins</a>)</li>
	<li>There is an general expectation that master is should be stable; work in progress should be held in a separate branch and submitted as a pull request once ready</li>
	<li>If a hot fix is required (e.g. due to some fairly critical issue in the latest release), the fixes are made on master, then a new branch is made from the previous release tag (say, 1.600), and the fixes are cherry-picked, and a new release (1.601) is made from that branch. The following release will be made from the tip of the master branch as usual</li>
</ul>


<p>This means there's generally a maximum of one week before a change in the master branch becomes available in a release.</p>

<h3 id="ReleaseProcess-Long-termSupport(LTS)Release">Long-term Support (LTS) Release</h3>

<p>There is another release line that lags behind in terms of new features, but provides more stability and a slower update cycle, called the <a href="LTS-Release-Line.html">LTS Release Line</a>.</p>

<h3 id="ReleaseProcess-Background">Background</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://meetings.jenkins-ci.org/jenkins/2015/jenkins.2015-03-04-19.00.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">March 2015</a>, it was decided to make releases directly from the master branch.</p>

<p>Prior to this, there was an <a href="http://hudson.361315.n4.nabble.com/New-release-plan-td392496.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">release candidate branch</a> which would be branched from master up to a week in advance of the release.  But very few people actively tested the RC builds, and this branching model made it more complicated to release a new Jenkins version on demand, e.g. if a hot fix was required.</p>
