This plugin allows for tracking multiple executions of a job remotely.</p>

<h1 id="JobRunUUIDPlugin-Introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>This plugin has been created to allow you to handle large numbers of multiple executions of a job more easily.</p>

<p>Each build is tagged with a UUID immediately on creation - allowing you to identify a build even before it leaves the queue and is given a &quot;Run Id&quot;. </p>

<p>You invoke the API as follows...</p>

<p><em>&lt;jenkins&gt;/job/&lt;your-job&gt;/buildId/execute</em></p>

<p>And it will respond with...</p>

<p><em>&quot;attempts&quot;:0,&quot;buildId&quot;:7,&quot;building&quot;:true,&quot;delay&quot;:0,&quot;errorCode&quot;:0,&quot;errorDesc&quot;:&quot;OK&quot;,&quot;format&quot;:&quot;json&quot;,&quot;responseCode&quot;:200,&quot;uuid&quot;:&quot;18712488-5a40-4ce7-bf6c-a05147a743ed&quot;</em></p>


<p>You can then request the status of the job by calling...</p>

<p><em>&lt;jenkins&gt;/job/&lt;your-job&gt;/buildId/findBuild?uuid=18712488-5a40-4ce7-bf6c-a05147a743ed</em></p>

<p>It becomes very useful when you invoke jobs than there are executors as you can track an invocation even if it does not have a buildId yet. The response from /execute looks like this</p>




<h1 id="JobRunUUIDPlugin-Example">Example</h1>

<p>Say, for example, you wanted to send out a customised release note to each of your clients. You know which clients are particularly interested in a feature/bug fix as they mark it as &quot;watched&quot; in JIRA so you'd like to prepare a release note thanking them for their continued support and to list the bugs they are most concerned about at the top of the information you send out.</p>

<p>You have over 50 clients though - oh-no! - and your infrastructure can only take 6 executing jobs at once. This could take forever...</p>

<p>By utilising this plugin, you can kick off all 50 builds and then use the plugin to track them to completion. </p>

<p><em>&lt;jenkins&gt;/job/release-notes/buildId/execute?client_name=Barbara&amp;client_company=Foobar</em><br/>
<em>&lt;jenkins&gt;/job/release-notes/buildId/execute?client_name=Jeff&amp;client_company=Snafulle</em><br/>
<em>&lt;jenkins&gt;/job/release-notes/buildId/execute?client_name=Fred&amp;client_company=Mixsticks </em><br/>
...</p>
