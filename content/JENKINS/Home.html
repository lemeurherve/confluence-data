We responded immediately by taking the affected server offline while we investigated the potential impact. At this time we have no reason to believe that any Jenkins releases, plugins, or source code have been affected.   Thus far in our investigation, we have learned that the Confluence CVE-2021-26084 exploit was used to install what we believe was a Monero miner in the container running the service. From there an attacker would not be able to access much of our other infrastructure. Confluence did integrate with our integrated identity system which... </span>

Abstract   The project/plugin aims to fully automate a release process.   The plugin tries to achieve this goal by automatically determining the next semantic version based on commit messages.   There were 2 coding phases in the GSoC 2021. I call the first phase - &quot;Read&quot; and the 2nd phase - &quot;Write&quot;, letâ€™s see why.     Phase 1: Read   In this phase, the... </span>
