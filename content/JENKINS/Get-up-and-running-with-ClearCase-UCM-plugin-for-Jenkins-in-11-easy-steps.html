                    <h1 id="GetupandrunningwithClearCaseUCMpluginforJenkinsin11easysteps-Prerequisites(4steps)">Prerequisites (4 steps)</h1>

<ol>
	<li>On Jenkins Master, go to Manage Jenkins-&gt;Manage Plugins-&gt;Available and install the ClearCase UCM Plugin</li>
	<li>Install ClearCase on each slave and the master</li>
	<li>Verify the Service user is ClearCase Admin.
	<ol>
		<li>The user account that runs the Jenkins must be seen by ClearCase as a member of ClearCase Admins Group. While you are at this, please log in as that user, configure the CLEARCASE_PRIMARY_GROUP, on each slave (and the master) so it point to your generic ClearCase Users Group. Please see <a href="http://www.ibm.com/support/docview.wss?uid=swg21135509" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">About the CLEARCASE_PRIMARY_GROUP variable</a> for more details. Must be done on each slave - and on the master.</li>
		<li>In case of multisite - and if a build slave runs on a different site than the master, then the jenkins service user, must be member of the ClearCase Administrators Group for that site.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Please read this section: ﻿<a href="ClearCase-UCM-Plugin.html#ClearCaseUCMPlugin-AdvancedSCMSetup">ClearCase UCM Plugin - Advanced SCM Setup</a> and then create a ClearCase UCM Project named &quot;jenkins&quot; and the hyperlink type &quot;tag&quot; in each PVOB that will be looked at by the plugin.</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="GetupandrunningwithClearCaseUCMpluginforJenkinsin11easysteps-Thefirstjob(4steps)">The first job (4 steps)</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Create a new jenkins job (or project) by clicking the &quot;New Job&quot; link, give it a name and select  Build a free-style software project</li>
	<li>In section &quot;Source Code Management&quot;, select ClearCase UCM, and enter appropiate, fully qualified values for stream and component, like &quot;SomeStream_Integration@&lt;vobtag&gt;&quot; and &quot;_RootLessComponent@&lt;vobtag&gt;&quot; - it it important to remember the vob qualifier. (For this initial test job, select a development stream of your own, and leave the poling mode as &quot;Poll self&quot;</li>
	<li>Add a build step - that will bulid your code - and for convenience, tick off the &quot;Poll SCM&quot; and fill out reasonable values.</li>
	<li>Save the Jenkins job, go to you development and make a baseline - and see that after polling have completed, Jenkins finds the new baseline, and starts your build.</li>
</ol>


<p>By this you are basically in business, and can start creating more jobs, that monitors more streams, and adds more rigorous testing and reporting to the build process - but wait! - that was only 8 steps? Well, you can if you have ClearCase Multisite, you can configure a bit more, and go all the way...</p>

<h1 id="GetupandrunningwithClearCaseUCMpluginforJenkinsin11easysteps-WithMultisiteanddevelopmentwithmixedmastership(3steps)">With Multisite and development with mixed mastership (3 steps)</h1>

<ol>
	<li>On Jenkins, go to Manage Jenkins, Scroll to the ClearCase UCM section, and tick off the &quot;Poll for Posted Deliveries&quot; checkbox</li>
	<li>On each site install our ACC_DELIVER_BASELINE trigger ( see <a href="http://wiki.praqma.net/acc/comp/triggers/acc_deliver_baseline" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">ACC_DELIVER_BASELINE Trigger</a> , where you will find installation instructions)
	<ol>
		<li>Short version of installation instructions for the trigger are: Use a mercurial client to clone the ACC repository from <a href="https://fogbugz.praqma.net/kiln/Code/acc/Development/Stable" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://fogbugz.praqma.net/kiln/Code/acc/Development/Stable</a>; to a file share accessible on each site </li>
		<li>Create the ClearCase attribute object type named &quot;ACC_VOBType&quot; in the PVOB, attach the attribute with value &quot;ccucm_plugin_supported&quot; in and on the replicated PVOB.</li>
		<li>When that change as been replicated, install the trigger by calling &quot;ratlperl &lt;unc_path_to_deliver_bl.pl&gt; -install -vob &lt;vobtag&gt;&quot; - see all the details the triggers wiki page referenced above.</li>
	</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Create a Jenkins job, that monitors an integration stream, and set the poll mode to Poll Child</li>
</ol>


<p>Now, whether you - who are assumed to be &quot;local&quot; to the integration stream - or your colleague on the remote site, are ready to with some code, you - or your colleague - will make a baseline, which will be found by the ClearCase UCM Plugin, and a build will be started.</p>
