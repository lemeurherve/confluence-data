<p>Please see the following wiki page for guidelines on how to create an issue: <a href="How-to-report-an-issue.html">How to report an issue</a></p>

<h1 id="IssueTracking-Lifecycleofanissue">Lifecycle of an issue</h1>

<h3 id="IssueTracking-IssueStates">Issue States</h3>

<p>Developers don't use the various issue states consistently. The following description just gives a broad overview. <a href="http://issues.jenkins-ci.org/secure/ShowConstantsHelp.jspa#StatusTypes" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">See here for a description of states in JIRA</a>.</p>

<ul>
	<li>Issues start out as <strong>Open</strong>.</li>
	<li>When work has begun but not finished, the <strong>Assignee</strong> will often mark the issue <strong>In progress</strong>.</li>
	<li>When finished and a solution is checked in, the <strong>Assignee</strong> (or a bot responding to commit messages) will mark the issue <strong>Resolved</strong></li>
	<li>Some users also mark issues <strong>Closed</strong> after a fix is confirmed by others.</li>
	<li>When an issue was resolved or closed before, but users still experience the same problem, they may set the issue to <strong>Reopened</strong>.</li>
</ul>


<h3 id="IssueTracking-Issuesnotrequiringachange">Issues not requiring a change</h3>

<p>If an issue is considered to be a <strong>Duplicate</strong>, it will be marked as resolved, and the original issue will be linked. It's not always the newer issue that gets closed as duplicate, sometimes it's the older one, e.g. when the description in the new one is better, or the new one has more watchers. This depends on the developer resolving as duplicate. Duplicate issues should only be reopened when you have determined that they are not actually a duplicate of the linked issue, and for no other reason.</p>

<p>Issues may be found to be <strong>Won't Fix</strong> or <strong>Not a Defect</strong> for various reasons, e.g. when a developer determines that the issue isn't actually a problem with Jenkins.</p>

<p>Issues may be resolved as <strong>Cannot Reproduce</strong> when the developer is unable to reproduce the issue as described, e.g. because it may have been resolved since it was reported, or it is believed the issue is not with Jenkins.</p>

<p>Issues resolved as <strong>Incomplete</strong> do not provide a sufficient description of the problem.</p>

<h3 id="IssueTracking-Issuesrequiringachange">Issues requiring a change</h3>

<p>When a developer decides to work on such an issue, the <strong>Assignee</strong> field is changed to that developer. It may be set to <strong>In progress</strong> while it's being worked on.</p>

<p>When a fix has been integrated, the issue is usually marked <strong>Resolved</strong> (using the resolution <strong>Fixed</strong>), and sometimes marked <strong>Closed</strong> after the fix has been verified.</p>

<h1 id="IssueTracking-QuickLinks">Quick Links</h1>

<p>If you want to link to a Jenkins bug with a short URL, use e.g.: <a href="http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/1234" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">http://jenkins-ci.org/issue/1234</a> instead of <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-1234" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-1234</a></p>
