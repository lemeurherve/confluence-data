                    <p>The Jenkins project is always looking for more contributions. Here are some of the possible areas:</p>

<h1 id="HelpWanted-Core:StrategicAreas">Core: Strategic Areas</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Personalization: notifications and UI should support more personalization. You should be able to subscribe any build notification in the form you like. Involves significant work in the core. What's cool: security and stapler, visible feedback on your work</li>
	<li>Intelligence: perform better test result analysis, especially around matrix testing. Analyze build/test failures and try to associate that with changes. What's cool: data-mining, smart heuristics</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="HelpWanted-IDEIntegration">IDE Integration</h1>
<p>IDE integration has a lot of interesting opportunities, like connecting test results with IDE, opening projects from Jenkins, and deferred commit.<br/>
What's cool: exposure to different technology set. Free-hand.</p>

<h1 id="HelpWanted-Maven&amp;Jenkins">Maven &amp; Jenkins</h1>
<p>A lot of users are moving more and more toward Maven, so a better support for Maven in Jenkins is desirable</p>
<ol>
	<li>Repository browser for Jenkins artifacts</li>
	<li>Maven release handling</li>
	<li>Maven site support</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="HelpWanted-Gradle&amp;Jenkins">Gradle &amp; Jenkins</h1>
<p>Doing a similar integration that we do for Maven would be useful.</p>

<h1 id="HelpWanted-DistributedSCM(Mercurial,git,etc)&amp;Jenkins">Distributed SCM (Mercurial,git,etc) &amp; Jenkins</h1>

<p>Distributed SCMs like git/Mercurial is picking up a steam, and a real distributed SCM has a lot of synergy with Jenkins. So investments in this area will likely be fruitful in the future:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Making Jenkins job a hg repository. In this way a repository can be constantly built/tested, and clone is as easy as job copy</li>
	<li>Repository browsing within Jenkins</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="HelpWanted-CommunityDevelopment">Community Development</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Start a regular Jenkins newsletter that summarizes current development efforts, major plugin releases, maybe list users who have committed code since the last newsletter, or bug fix statistics.</li>
	<li>Blog aggregation, with Google Reader: tag posts by random people and aggregate them in a single feed</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="HelpWanted-QAtools">QA tools</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Build a mechanism to utilize VMs to be able to exercise some parts of Jenkins.</li>
	<li>Include code coverage from plugin test execution in the core's coverage report</li>
	<li>Participate in the LTS testing effort.</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="HelpWanted-Localization">Localization</h1>

<ol>
	<li>localize core and plugins to your own language</li>
	<li>develop or integrate tools that show the degree of translation per language, as an incentive for l10n contributors.</li>
</ol>


<h1 id="HelpWanted-Misc">Misc</h1>

<ol>
	<li>Better monitoring&amp;management. Monitor resource utilization, report where to add more resources</li>
	<li>Wake-on-lan support for greener computing</li>
</ol>
