<p>The Jenkins project provides travel grants to a limited number of community members requesting assistance. Each travel grant supports your travel to a Jenkins community event such as Jenkins User Conferences with up to 500 USD.</p>

<h2 id="TravelGrantProgram-Eligibility">Eligibility</h2>

<p>All community members are eligible for support unless they've received a travel grant within the last year (based on the event's date). However, as we have very limited funds to support this program, we'll prefer applications by active contributors to the Jenkins project.</p>

<p>If you have other possible funding sources, please look to them first. This will allow more people to attend a Jenkins community event.</p>

<h2 id="TravelGrantProgram-Application">Application</h2>

<p>To apply for a travel grant, send an email with the following information to the jenkinsci-dev mailing list <strong>at least two months before the event</strong> you want to attend:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Your name</li>
	<li>The event you'd like to attend</li>
	<li>The expected cost of travel (airfare, hotel, conference fees, etc.)</li>
	<li>A description of your contributions to the Jenkins project, such as:
	<ul>
		<li>Plugins you developed</li>
		<li>Pull requests you authored</li>
		<li>Documentation you wrote</li>
		<li>Public presentations on Jenkins-related topics</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Why should we sponsor <em>your</em> trip?</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="TravelGrantProgram-ReviewProcess">Review Process</h2>

<p>We'll review your application at a <a href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Governance+Meeting+Agenda" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Jenkins project meeting</a>. This meeting is usually biweekly. While you're free to attend the meeting in case there are any questions, please refrain from more active participation while your application is being discussed.</p>

<p>You will receive our response at least four weeks before the event. This response will include the sponsored amount (less than 500 USD if your travel costs are less) as well as who to send your receipts (see below) to.</p>

<h2 id="TravelGrantProgram-Yourduties">Your duties</h2>

<p>If you've been selected for a travel grant, we'll expect you to be available for a blog post about this program before the event.</p>

<p>After the trip, please submit a travel report to jenkinsci-dev (same thread as your application). This report should include the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>What you accomplished at the event</li>
	<li>What you learned at the event</li>
	<li>Contacts you made</li>
	<li>Other useful information</li>
</ul>


<p>We also expect you to submit your receipts via email to the person mentioned in the travel grant confirmation for review. We will reimburse actually incurred costs up to the 500 USD limit.</p>
