<pre>I am looking at Jenkins from time to time and this time I got as far
as reading up on creating plugins for Jenkins. What I am wondering is
why one would need Maven to build Jenkin&#39;s plugins?

Isn&#39;t this more complicated for a &quot;simple&quot; Java developer to have to
read up on and set up Maven rather than just implementing an
interface, adding registration of the custom class and dumping a jar
with it into a lib folder?
</pre>

<p>I do realize that Maven can be a real pain to work with. It is especially so if you are new to Maven, and your concern is understandable. But this is a conscious decision. There are several reasons why I felt the benefits of Maven outweighs its problems when it comes to Jenkins plugins:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Jenkin's build process involves a certain amount of source code pre-processing. If you are to do this with Ant, your build script will get a bit more complicated.</li>
	<li>The packaging of the plugin .hpi file involves a certain amount of conventions, such as listing other plugin dependencies. Doing this manually is error prone, and again, your build script will get a bit more complicated.</li>
	<li>Doing this as a Maven plugin makes it possible for us to provide the &quot;hpi:run&quot; goal. This is a critical piece of a faster edit/build/debug experience. Without Maven, this is highly non-trivial.</li>
</ul>


<p>I think an interesting possibility might be to let a scripting language define a plugin, so that you can do some simple things very easily.</p>
