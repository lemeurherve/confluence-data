<p>This is a simple plugin that adds a post build action to mail upstream committers when a build fails. This plugin is useful when you have a downstream job that uses an artifact produced by an upstream build.</p>


<p>Once you install the plugin, ensure that it is properly installed by looking at the bottom of the job's configuration page, where the following checkbox should be available:</p>

<p> Mail upstream committers when the build fails</p>

<p>It is important to notice that:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Only builds that are actually triggered by an upstream build will actually send the mail</li>
	<li>If the upstream job did not include any SCM update at all, it won't trigger the mail (as expected)</li>
</ul>


<h2 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-JobsSetup">Jobs Setup</h2>

<p>This plugin is only capable of blaming upstream committers if the job is linked by some dependency to the upstream job. The relation is created using fingerprints. Look how to <a href="Fingerprint.html">fingerprint here</a> or just follow the steps below for a quick start.</p>

<h6 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-1.Createtheupstream/downstreamrelationshipbysettingeditingthedownstreamjobandenteringinformationinthefollowingfield:">1. Create the upstream/downstream relationship by setting editing the downstream job and entering information in the following field:</h6>

<p>  <strong>Build after other projects are built</strong></p>

<p>Enter the upstream project name in the input box. It is also possible to create the same relationship by editing the upstream job configuration</p>

<p>  <strong>Build other projects</strong></p>

<p>Both method will work for our purposes</p>

<h6 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-2.Dependencylink">2. Dependency link</h6>

<p>This plugin works when the downstream job uses an artifact produced by the upstream job. To create such relationship you'll need to setup the downstream job in such a way that it fetchs the upstream's produced artifact and this artifact must be fingerprinted in both jobs. Let's see how to do that:</p>

<h6 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-2.1Fingerprinttheartifacttobeusedintheupstreamjob">2.1 Fingerprint the artifact to be used in the upstream job</h6>

<p>In the Post-build Actions section, you'l find the following option:</p>

<p>  <strong>Record fingerprints of files to track usage</strong></p>

<p>When this option is checked, a &quot;Files to fingerprint&quot; input box will become avaiable. You can specify the file explicitly or using wildcards. Just make sure the file to be used by the downstream job is fingerprinted.</p>

<p>Notice that if this is a Maven project, this option will not be available. In fact, maven jobs automatically fingerprints any produced jars that are archived.</p>

<h6 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-2.2Fetchtherequiredartifactinthedownstreamjob">2.2 Fetch the required artifact in the downstream job</h6>

<p>You'll have to find a way to get the produced artifact. If both jobs are executed in the same computer, you can just copy the file from the workspace. This is not such a good option, since it forces both jobs workspaces to be in the same filesystem. A better option is to download the file somehow (for example, using wget or an ant task) from the upstream's urls.</p>

<h6 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-2.3Fingerprinttheartifactinthedownstreamjob">2.3 Fingerprint the artifact in the downstream job</h6>

<p>Finally, the downstream job must fingerprint the downloaded file. You'll use the same post-build action as in the upstream job.</p>

<h6 id="BlameUpstreamCommittersPlugin-2.4Checkthe&quot;Mailupstreamcommitterswhenthejobfails&quot;">2.4 Check the &quot;Mail upstream committers when the job fails&quot;</h6>


<p>That's all you need to go.</p>


<p>Once you follow the above steps, the jobs will be properly linked and the upstream committers will be mailed when the downstream job fails.</p>
