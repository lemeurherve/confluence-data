There you'll likely see the reason for failure, e.g. a version code conflict or similar.</p><p>Otherwise, please file a bug report or send an email with details, including the build console log output; see info box at the top of the page.</p><p>Some known error messages and their solutions are shown below:</p><h3 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-GoogleJsonResponseException:401Unauthorized">GoogleJsonResponseException: 401 Unauthorized</h3><p>This means that the Google service account does not have permission to make the changes that you requested.</p><p>Make sure that you followed the setup instructions above, and confirm that the service account you are using in this Jenkins job has the appropriate permissions for the app that you are trying to change.</p><h3 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-GoogleJsonResponseException:500InternalServerError">GoogleJsonResponseException: 500 Internal Server Error</h3><p>Unfortunately, the Google Play API sometimes is not particularly reliable, and will throw generic server errors for no apparent reason.</p><p>In these cases you can try running your build again, or wait a few hours before retrying, if the problem persists.</p><p>Please also consider <a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/contact/publishing?extra.IssueType=submitting&amp;hl=en&amp;ec=publish&amp;cfsi=publish_cf&amp;cfnti=escalationflow.email&amp;cft=3&amp;rd=1" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">contacting Google Play Developer Support</a> to help make them aware that people use the Google Play API, and that it should preferably work in a reliable manner.</p><p>This plugin already recognises some temporary Google Play API server problems and works around them; more workarounds may be added in future, e.g. automatically retrying when a generic server error is encountered.</p><h3 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-Unabletoretrieveanaccesstokenwiththeprovidedcredentials">Unable to retrieve an access token with the provided credentials</h3><p>If you see this error message, look further down the error log to see what is causing it.

Add the appropriate http versions of those flags too, if unsecured HTTP requests also need to go through the proxy.</p><h2 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-Frequentlyaskedquestions">Frequently asked questions</h2><p><span class="confluence-anchor-link" id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-flavours"></span></p><h3 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-WhatifIwanttouploadAPKswithmultiple,differentapplicationIDs(i.e.buildflavours)?">What if I want to upload APKs with multiple, different application IDs (i.e. build flavours)?</h3><p>Using the build flavours feature of the Android Gradle build system, it's possible to have a single Android build which produces multiple APKs, each with a different application ID.<br/>e.g. You could have application IDs &quot;com.example.app&quot; and &quot;com.example.app.pro&quot; for free and paid versions.</p><p>As these will often be built in a single Jenkins job, people have wondered why this plugin will refuse to upload APKs with differing application IDs in a single freestyle job.</p><p>However, as far as Google Play is concerned, these are completely separate apps. This is correct and, as such, they should be uploaded in separate Jenkins builds: one per application ID.</p><p>If the plugin did allow this and you were to attempt to upload, say three, completely different APKs in one Jenkins build, this would require opening and committing three separate &quot;edit sessions&quot; with the Google Play API. If any one of these were to fail — maybe because of an invalid APK, versionCode conflict, or due to an API failure (which, unfortunately, is not uncommon with the Google Play API) — you would end up with your Google Play account in an inconsistent state. Your Jenkins build would be marked as failed, but one or more applications will have actually been uploaded and published to Google Play, and you would have to fix the situation manually. Also, you would not be able to simply re-run the build, as it would fail due to already-existing APKs.</p><p>The best practice in this case would be to have one job that builds the different flavours (i.e. the APKs with different application IDs) and then, if the build is successful, it would archive the APKs and start multiple &quot;downstream&quot; Jenkins builds which individually publish each of the applications.<br/>This can be achieved, for example, with the Parameterized Trigger Plugin and the Copy Artifacts Plugin, i.e. the &quot;upload&quot; job could be generic, and would receive the APK information via parameter.</p><p>Alternatively, if you have version 1.5 of this plugin, and use the <a href="Pipeline-Plugin.html">Pipeline Plugin</a>, you should be able to use the <code>androidApkUpload</code> step multiple times within a single build.</p><h2 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-Versionhistory">Version history</h2><h3 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-Version2.0(July17,2019)">Version 2.0 (July 17, 2019)</h3><ul><li>Upgraded to <a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2019/03/changes-to-google-play-developer-api.html" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">v3</a> of the Google Play Developer Publishing API (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/jhansche" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Joe Hansche</a>)</li><li>Fixed various potential NullPointerExceptions if no APKs had been uploaded already (thanks to <a href="https://github.com/kazuhidet" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">Kazuhide Takahashi</a>)</li><li>Increased minimum Jenkins version to 2.60.3</li></ul><h3 id="GooglePlayAndroidPublisherPlugin-Version1.8(June3,2018)">Version 1.8 (June 3, 2018)</h3><ul><li>Enabled ability to upload to the &quot;internal&quot;
