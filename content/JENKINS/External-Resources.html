It catches bugs early on, and increases the quality of our software products. This, in turn, reduces the overall cost of developing innovative software in any environment - startups and enterprise alike. Today the technology sector is experiencing a boom throughout the world. There are hundreds of startups launching every day. In order to move quickly, these startups need people who are skilled at automating as much as possible. Mostly, progressive startups favor implementing completely automated DevOps pipelines from the get go. They realize that these practices of continuous integration (CI) and DevOps will yield tremendous benefits in terms of speed and agility.</p><p><br/></p><ul><li><p><strong><a href="https://www.packtpub.com/web-development/devops-aws-codepipeline-jenkins-and-aws-codedeploy-video" class="external-link" rel="nofollow">DevOps with AWS CodePipeline, Jenkins and AWS CodeDeploy [Video]</a></strong> by Manuj Aggarwal, TetraTutorials Team, Packt (February 2018)</p></li></ul><p>AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeDeploy is a highly scalable and configurable toolset from Amazon AWS, which enables us to build very sophisticated automated build and deployment pipelines.
